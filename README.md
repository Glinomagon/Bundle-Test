- What did you choose to mock the API and why?
I chose to use axios-mock-adapter as it closely resembles axios calls
which I am familiar with

- If you used an AI tool, what parts did it help with?
It helped me in debugging small errors (e.g. spelling mistakes, missed variable etc.)

- What tradeoffs or shortcuts did you take?
Due to the limited time constraint, I couldn't refine the component to be more readable and
have less redundancy. I also ended up not having to style the component.

- What would you improve or add with more time?
Add css styling to make it look prettier. And also refine the code to be more readable and have
less lines.

- What was the trickiest part and how did you debug it?
Writing the pollTask() function. I had to use some AI tools (chatGPT) in order to help
debug some logic errors.
